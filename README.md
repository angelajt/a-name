My first repository; a sort of a test thing

I honestly do not know what I'm aiming for with this thing.  Right now it's looking like I'm just messing around and
playing around with GitHub, which is probably true.

But who knows?  I might someday make something useful.  Probably not today, maybe not even tomorrow.  But someday in the
future, something will happen.
